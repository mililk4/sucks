sucks
=====

A simple command-line python script to drive a robot vacuum. Currently
known to work with the Ecovacs Deebot N79, M80 Pro, M81, and M88
Pro from both North America and Europe.

Does it work for your model as well? Join the discussion on the
[sucks-users mailing
list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sucks-users).

If you're curious about the protocol, I have [a rough doc](protocol.md)
started. I'll happily accept pull requests for it.

Why the project name? Well, a) it's ridiculous that I needed to MITM
my own vacuum.  This is not the future I signed up for. There should
be a nice, tidy RESTful API. That would be easy enough to make. And b),
it's a vacuum.

## Installation

Check out this code, possibly create a virtualenv, and do
`pip install pipenv; pip install -e .`. If that doesn't work for
you, please [open an issue](https://github.com/wpietri/sucks/issues).

## Usage

To get started, you'll need to have already set up an EcoVacs account
using your smartphone. I've only tested this with Android, but I expect
it will work with iPhone-created accounts as well.

Step one is to log in:
```
    % sucks login
    Ecovacs app email: [your email]
    Ecovacs app password: [your password]
    your two-letter country code: us
    your two-letter contienent code: na
    Config saved.
```

That creates a config file in ~/.config.sucks.conf. The password is
hashed before saving, so it's reasonably safe.

With that set up, you could have it clean in auto mode for 10 minutes
and return to its charger:

```
    % sucks clean 10
```

You could have it clean for 15 minutes and then do an extra 10 minutes
of edging:

```
    % sucks clean 15 edge 10
```

If you wanted it to clean for 5 minutes and then stop without charging:

```
    % sucks clean 5 stop
```

If it's running amok and you'd just like it to stop where it is:

```
    % sucks stop
```

To tell it to go plug in:

```
    % sucks charge
```

I run mine from my crontab, but I didn't want it to clean every day,
so it also has a mode where it randomly decides to run or not based on
a frequency you give it. My crontab entry looks like this:

```
0 10 * * * /home/william/projects/sucks/sucks clean -f 4/7 15 edge -f 1/14 10
```

This means that every day at 10 am, it might do something. 4 days out
of 7, it will do 15 minutes of automatic cleaning. 1 day out of 14,
it will do 10 minutes of edging. And afterward it will always go back to
charge.

## Library use

You are welcome to try using this as a python library for other efforts. The
API is still experimental, so expect changes. Please join the [mailing
list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sucks-users) to participate in
shaping the API.

A simple usage might go something like this:

```
include sucks

config = ...

api = EcoVacsAPI(config['device_id'], config['email'], config['password_hash'],
                         config['country'], config['continent'])
my_vac = api.devices()[0]
vacbot = VacBot(api.uid, api.REALM, api.resource, api.user_access_token, my_vac, config['continent'])
vacbot.connect_and_wait_until_ready()

vacbot.run(Clean(900)) # clean for 15 minutes
vacbot.run(Charge()) # return to the charger
```

## Developing

If you'd like to join in on developing, I recommend checking out the code,
doing `pipenv install` to set up a virtual environment, and then `pipenv shell`
to start using it. You can run the existing tests using `nosetests`. Current
test are not yet comprehensive, as the integrated nature of this makes it difficult.
But I aim to reduce that problem over time, so please add tests as you go.


## Thanks

My heartfelt thanks to:

a great library for examining XMPP traffic flows (yes, your vacuum
speaks Jabbber!),
* [mitmproxy](https://mitmproxy.org/), a fantastic tool for analyzing HTTPS,
* [click](http://click.pocoo.org/), a wonderfully complete and thoughtful
library for making Python command-line interfaces,
* [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/), a polished Python
library for HTTP requests,
* [Decompilers online](http://www.javadecompilers.com/apk), which was
very helpful in figuring out what the Android app was up to,
* Albert Louw, who was kind enough to post code from [his own
experiments](https://community.smartthings.com/t/ecovacs-deebot-n79/93410/33)
with his device, and
* All the users who have given useful feedback and reported on how it is
working for them.
